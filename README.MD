# SSHIFT

SSHift is a Linux CLI tool built to make everyday ssh'ing faster.  Whether you are trying to access private networks through a public proxy, or are just tired of typing tedious ssh commands.  SShift isn't a necessary tool, but it is nice.

SSHift is still under development and we could use your help.  Here are some features that need work.

  - Map Generator: The ability to populate the map.yml file from existing /etc/hosts file.  
  - Yaml Parser: The ability to parse the map.yml and execute the logic necessary to append to the /etc/hosts file and scp into the hosts provided in the map appending to their /etc/hosts as well as creating aliases for the ssh command.
  - Fancy ASCII art for when the command is first run to impress the pants off people.
  - Magic
